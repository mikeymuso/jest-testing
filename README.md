## Unit Testing

As a small project with 'The Odin Project' I created these small tests with Jest to practice a test-first situation.

In each case I created the tests with the expected results first and only once these tests were created did I implement each function until all tests passed.

## Takeaways

- I learnt how unit-testing can help speed up the process of coding by initially spending time setting out expectations of functions and fulfilling these with code.
- Unit testing makes it clear where the errors are ocurring
- It keeps one focused on the task in hand
- It is better to keep track of things as we go than let our reach complexity that makes error-tracking difficult
- Jest is a useful, established tool for code testing, gives us easily readable results and will process all tests without stopping at an error
